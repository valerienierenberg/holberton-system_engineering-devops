# 0x0F-load_balancer

## Learning Objectives

You have been given 2 additional servers:

- gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
- gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX

Let’s improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.

- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
- Your servers

## Task Descriptions

- 0-custom_http_response_header : In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!
- 1-install_load_balancer : Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.
- 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp : Just as in task #0, we’d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.
