## Learning Objectives

- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints youâ€™re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value


## File Descriptions

- 0-subs.py -  function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers (not active users, total subscribers) for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.
- 1-top_ten.py - function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit.
- 2-recurse.py - recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None. Hint: The Reddit API uses pagination for separating pages of responses.
    - Requirements:
        - Prototype: def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])
        - Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied. AKA you can add a counter, but it must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
        - If not a valid subreddit, return None.
        - NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are not following redirects.
- 100-count.py - recursive function that queries the Reddit API, parses the title of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords (case-insensitive, delimited by spaces. Javascript should count as javascript, but java should not).
    - Requirements:
        - Prototype: def count_words(subreddit, word_list)
        - Note: You may change the prototype, but it must be able to be called with just a subreddit supplied and a list of keywords. AKA you can add a counter or anything else, but the function must work without supplying a starting value in the main.
        - If word_list contains the same word (case-insensitive), the final count should be the sum of each duplicate (example below with java)
        - Results should be printed in descending order, by the count, and if the count is the same for separate keywords, they should then be sorted alphabetically (ascending, from A to Z). Words with no matches should be skipped and not printed. Words must be printed in lowercase.
        - Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears, not titles it appears in. java java java counts as 3 separate occurrences of java.
        - To make life easier, java. or java! or java_ should not count as java
        - If no posts match or the subreddit is invalid, print a newline.
        - NOTE: Invalid subreddits may return a redirect to search results. Ensure that you are NOT following redirects.
